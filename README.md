Subject: Clarification on Wings 1 Certification Tracks and Unit Elective External Certifications

Dear [Unit TD‚Äôs Name],

I hope you are doing well. I have a few queries regarding the Wings 1 certification process:

1. For freshers/trainees, is it mandatory to select a track BG/Unit-wise, or can they choose any track?


2. Regarding Unit Elective External Certification:

Is it valid for the Nov 2025 cycle?
