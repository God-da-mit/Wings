# Wings

Dear Sir/Madam,
I hope you are doing well. I have a few queries regarding the Wings 1 certification process:
  (A) For freshers/trainees, is it mandatory to select a track BG/Unit-wise, or can they choose any track?
  (B) Regarding Unit Elective External Certification:
Is it valid for the Nov 2025 cycle?
What is the process to pursue this certification, and where should we upload the details?
Please confirm if the below list (for GM INDIA Unit) is correct:
